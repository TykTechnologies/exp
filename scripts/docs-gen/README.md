# Documentation

The scripts contained within this folder aim to provide documentation
with detailed version information as to which fields have been added in
which versions. It does this by:

- Ensuring git checkouts of all release branches in the 5.X range
- Collecting machine readable data model dumps for each release
- Aggregation of the data model dumps to provide docs with version info

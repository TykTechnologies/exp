# modcheck

This tool will go through the imports in go.mod and check with the
official go proxy to get a list of versions for each of the imports.

Run `modcheck` in your repo where `go.mod` exists.

Install:

```
go install github.com/TykTechnologies/exp/cmd/gomod@main
```

The report is provided in markdown output, suitable for github issues.

Example output for itself:

| IMPORT                 | VERSION                              | LATEST       | WARNINGS                        |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| olekukonko/tablewriter | v0.0.6 0.20230925090304 df64c4bbad77 | v0.0.5       | Version ahead of latest release |
| golang.org/x/mod       | v0.14.0                              | âœ“ Up to date |                                 |

Several warnings are printed:

- Bad request, possibly renamed (Jeffail/gabs becomes jeffail/gabs)
- Dependency without go.mod (important for plugin compiler conflicts)
- Version ahead of latest release (typically `master` or `main` branch at some commit)
- Deprecated import (gopkg.in is pre-go.mod and should not be used)
